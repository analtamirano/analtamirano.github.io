    <h1>Angelica Altamirano</h1>
    <p>I love watching movies in my spare time and one of my <em>favorite</em> genre of movies is sci-fi/fantasy. The reason I love sci-fi and fantasy so much is because I love the often futuristic and apocolyptic
      feel these movies have. When I watch movies, I want to forget about real world problems for a while and be transported into an entirely different place. One of my favorite sci-fi fantasy movies is
      Blade Runner 2049. It is a sequel to the 1980's classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> and continues the story of the complex relationship between replicants and humans.
      With director Denis Villeneuve, cinematographor Roger Deakins, and a score by Hans Zimmer, this movie gets as close to <em>perfect</em> as possible. </p>
